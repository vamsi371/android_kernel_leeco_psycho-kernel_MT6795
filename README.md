#Psycho Mods



###Psycho Kernel 

The first ever custom kernel for LeEco Le 1s(x500, x507 & x509) made specially for best performance and a great battery life!
The kernel is still under active development and is meant to be completely been developed by the whole community for our 1s so everyone can get their taste in it!
So all developers are free to modify and patch the sources to their to make it better!

* Added few extra CPU governers and I/O schedulars.
  -More of your favorite Custom CPU governers and Schedulars are welcome!
* Made it **Open to All** for better development
    
    --> **Fix Needed**
         Added Tap to wake and sweep to wake/sleep in kernel but is not functional! A fix for that is required!
